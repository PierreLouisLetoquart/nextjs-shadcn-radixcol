# Next.js + Shadcn-ui + Radix Colors

This is a simple project to show how to use Shadcn-ui with Next.js and Radix Colors.

The Radix colors are imported and sets in the `src/styles/globals.css` file. All the Sadcn-ui components are modified with the Radix colors **if needed**.

Dark mode is also implemented in this project.
